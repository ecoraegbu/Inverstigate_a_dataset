    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description \n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzes the data regarding the failure of appointees to keep their date or appointments. I would be investigating the factors responsible for the failure of patients to show up for their appointments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset analyzed represents a sample size of over 100 thousand medical appointments in Brazil. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.\n",
    "Based on My findings, I should be able to predict whether or not a patient would show up for his/her appointment and explain why.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Column Names**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The following variables are analyzed in this data set\n",
    "1. PatientId    : This is a unique identifier for each patient. No two patient has the same Id. \n",
    "2. AppointmentID : Uniquely identifies the appointment records and details. Again this is unique for each appointment made.  \n",
    "3. Gender: Tells us whether the patient is male or female           \n",
    "4. ScheduledDay : this tells us the time that the appointment was fixed for on the appointment day (this should be renamed as scheduledTime because there is another column that tells us what date the appointment was for)this tells us what day the appointment was set for. \n",
    "5. AppointmentDay: This column gives us information about the date of the appointment. the date is formatted as pd.datetime  \n",
    "6. Age    : Specifies the age of the patients         \n",
    "7. Neighbourhood : this tells us the location of the hospital. unfortunately there is no measurement of the distance between the hospital and the location. this would have provided an insight into how distance affects the tendency to keep appointments\n",
    "8. Scholarship : indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa FamÃ­lia. \n",
    "9. Hipertension\n",
    "10. Diabetes        \n",
    "11. Alcoholism      \n",
    "12. Handcap         \n",
    "13. SMS_received \n",
    "14. No-show : Tells us whether the patient showed up or not for their appointment. It says NO if they did and yes if they didn't\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question(s) for Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?\n",
    "2. Do Females have more tendency to show up for their appointments than Males (is gender a factor?)\n",
    "3. Does the appointment time influence whether or not a patient shows up for their appointment?\n",
    "4. Are people above a certain age more or less inclined to show up for their appointments\n",
    "5. Are people below a certain age more or less inclined to show up for thei appointments\n",
    "6. if the health program is free, are the patients more likely to show up for their appointments?\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Tip**: Clearly state one or more questions that you plan on exploring over the course of the report. You will address these questions in the **data analysis** and **conclusion** sections. Try to build your report around the analysis of at least one dependent variable and three independent variables. If you're not sure what questions to ask, then make sure you familiarize yourself with the dataset, its variables and the dataset context for ideas of what to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**: Once you start coding, use NumPy arrays, Pandas Series, and DataFrames where appropriate rather than Python lists and dictionaries. Also, **use good coding practices**, such as, define and use functions to avoid repetitive code. Use appropriate comments within the code cells, explanation in the mark-down cells, and meaningful variable names. "

    "> **Tip**: You should _not_ perform too many operations in each cell. Create cells freely to explore your data. One option that you can take with this project is to do a lot of explorations in an initial notebook. These don't have to be organized, but make sure you use enough comments to understand the purpose of each code cell. Then, after you're done with your analysis, create a duplicate notebook where you will trim the excess and organize your steps so that you have a flowing, cohesive report."
